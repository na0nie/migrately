# Migrately

Migrately is a web application that aims to simplify the U.S. visa and immigration journey by combining the power of community and technology.
Migrately is an MVP, and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.
